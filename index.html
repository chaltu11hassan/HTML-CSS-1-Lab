    <h4> Welcome, Coffee lovers!</h4>
    <p>Fun Fact: Did you know we came to love coffee because of some goats? Apparently, some guy tending to
         his goats noticed his animals became livelier after eating a certain berry. He boiled the berries 
         to make the first coffee. Here we are today, acting like some goats and enjoying our coffee!</p>
